        <h1>Exam, Python elective Spring 2019</h1>

        <h2>Exam flow</h2>
        <p>The exam is an oral exam where part of it is based on your handed in project. The exam is evaluated after the
            7 step scale.</p>
        <p>The 3 last weeks of this elective you will be given 4 projects from which you should choose 1 as your exam
            project.</p>
        <p>The project should be published at Github and a link to the repository should be handed in on Wiseflow. If
            your repository is private you should grant me (clbokea - clbo@kea.dk) access to your private repository.
        </p>
        <p>The project should be in a state where it is possible to clone the project and run it on the teacher and
            sencors computers. There should be a readme file in the repository describing the project and how to install
            and run it.
        </p>
        <p>If you fail to hand in the project, you can not attend the exam.
        </p>

        <p>Exam time: Total 30 min.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 min. presentation and demo of your project (not the code)
                <ul>
                    <li>Be sure to demonstrate that you solved the tasks stated in the requirents.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>7-8 min. questions about your project (here we look at your code)</li>
            <li>10-12 min. general questions based on the curriculum</li>
            <li>5 min. grading and feed-back</li>
            <li>5 minutes buffer</li>

        </ul>

        <p>You will be graded on the:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>overall state of the handed in project.</li>
            <li>presentation of the project.</li>
            <li>quality of the code and documentation.</li>
            <li>abillity to answer questions connected to the project.</li>
            <li>level of understanding of the general curriculum.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>During the exam the you will be asked to do "live coding".</p>

        <p>The projects from where the you should choose 1 exam project are:</p>

        <h2>Specific projects</h2>
        <p>You can read about the specific project by folowing the links in the <a href="#menu">menu above</a></p>

        <h2>General for all projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The project should be finished, meaning: donÂ´t hand in and show up at the exam with something half done.
            </li>
            <li>Your code will be evaluated in terms of readability</li>
            <li>Your project will be evaluated in relation to the extent to which it is perceived as a finished product.
            </li>
            <li>The code should be documented and you should be able to explain why you documented your code in the way
                you
                did.</li>
            <li>The code should be tested and you should at the exam be abel to talk about your tests and demonstate
                them.</li>

        </ul>
        <p> All projects have been solved by someone else in the world before you, so it would be possible to pip
            install a
            module that more or less solves the task. It is not a good idea to use this approach. You should solve the
            task from scratch and use the python teqniques you learned during this semester.
            On the other hand it is fine to use the build in modules that we used during this semester, and it can also make sense in some cases to use 3rd party modules.</p>
